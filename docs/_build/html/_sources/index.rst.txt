About Me
========

👋 Hi there! I'm Paul, a PhD student at the University of Basel, Department of Sport, Exercise and Health. My two supervisors are `Prof. Oliver Faude <https://dsbg.unibas.ch/de/personen/oliver-faude/>`_ and `Prof. Christoph Handschin <https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/research-groups-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-christoph-handschin>`_.

📚 My PhD project focuses on understanding the relationship between muscle form and function in various human populations such as soccer players, middle-aged healthy adults, and older adults. By combining measurements of muscle micro- and macrostructure with functional parameters like strength, we aim to provide a comprehensive view on the "function follows form" paradigm.

🖥️ Besides my PhD, I'm working on the (fully) automated analysis of muscle ultrasonography images to calculate estimates of anatomical cross-sectional area, fascicle length, and pennation angle. I'm passionate about intuitive UI design and open science.

🏅 When I'm not immersed in research, I'm a sports enthusiast who loves all kinds of sports. I'm also a proud cat parent to Rosy and Joey.

Feel free to explore my site and learn more about my work and interests!
