*Welcome to my personal website and portfolio. Here, you can find information about me, my current projects and the projects I've worked on. Moreover, I try to almost regularly come up with a blog post which is most often related to musculoskeletal ultrasonography.*

About Me
========

I am Paul, a PhD student at the University of Basel, Department of Sport, Exercise and Health. My two supervisors are `Prof. Oliver Faude <https://dsbg.unibas.ch/de/personen/oliver-faude/>`_ and `Prof. Christoph Handschin <https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/research-groups-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-christoph-handschin>`_.
My PhD project aims at determining the relation between muscle form and function in different human populations such as soccer players, middle aged healthy adults and older adults. By aiming to combine measurements of muscle micro- and macrostructure as well as functional parameters such as strength, we intent to provide a holistic view on the "function follows form" paradigm.

Next to my PhD, I am working on the (fully) automated analysis of muscle ultrasonography images to calculate estimates of anatomical cross-sectional area, fascicle length and pennation angle. I am passionate about intuitive UI desing and open science.

Apart from that I am a sports enthusiast of basically all sports and a big fan of cats (especially my own ones, Rosy and Joey).
